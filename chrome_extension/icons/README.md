# Extension Icons

To complete the extension setup, you need to add the following icon files in this directory:

- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can:
1. Create your own icons using an image editor
2. Use a placeholder icon generator
3. Use your company logo resized to these dimensions

The icons should be in PNG format and named exactly as listed above.

For testing purposes, you can temporarily use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images, but make sure to replace them with your official branding before publishing the extension.
